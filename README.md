## Interpolation Search Algorithm

The `interpolation_search.cpp` file contains the C++ implementation of the interpolation search algorithm. This algorithm is particularly useful for uniformly distributed data in a sorted array.

## Demo Presentation

The `presentation.pdf` file provides a comprehensive overview of the interpolation search algorithm. It covers the theoretical aspects, the rationale behind choosing interpolation search, and its practical applications.

## Video Explanation

For a more detailed explanation and demonstration of the algorithm, check out the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUnCijqHpU). The video walks through the code implementation, illustrates its execution, and provides insights into the algorithm's efficiency.
